# Spring Social CloudFoundry
Spring Social CloudFoundry is an extension to [SpringSocial](http://www.springsource.org/spring-social) to enable connectivity to [CloudFoundry](http://www.cloudfoundry.com), the open PaaS by VMware.

Basically, this is a wrapper around the [VCAP java client](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap-java-client), helping in creating an instance of `CloudFoundryClient` using an OAuth2 token.
